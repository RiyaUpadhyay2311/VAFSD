        Zomato (/zoʊmætoʊ/ or /zmtoʊ/)[5] is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. It was founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008.[6] Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022–23.[7] Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyperlocal space.

History
Early years (2008  2011)
Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[8][9][10]


Zomato logo in 2012
With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[11] Later in 2011, Zomato officially launched an online ticketing platform for events.[12]

Expansion (2011  2015)
In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[13] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[14] Qatar,[15] the United Kingdom,[16] the Philippines,[15] and South Africa.[17] In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand,[18] Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages.[19] In April 2014, it was launched in Chile and Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland in 2015.[20][21][22]
